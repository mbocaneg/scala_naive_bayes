# Scala Naive Bayes
A naive bayes classifier implemented in the Scala programming language. At the moment, it only operates on weka formated .arff categorical datasets only. Two sample datasets, `contact_lens.arff` and the classic `tennis.arff` are included for testing purposes. Datasets are used for both training and validation.
